Hi, my name is Pasquale.

I run a business called Digital Handyman LLC and would like the opportunity to handle whatever technology-related project that you have.  I am well-versed in most things from hardware to software and am capable of learning anything new that might be needed.  I have decades of experience with programming, building/repairing electronics (including PCs) and networking.  

Feel free to email me at pranalli@gmail.com or call/text to (412) 498-6701.  I am primarily based out of the northern New Jersey region, but am able to travel and/or do much work remoately.
